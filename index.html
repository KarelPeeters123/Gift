        <p>
            Happy Birthday Lujane!! I hope your birthday is already going well! <br>
            For your birthday I have put togehter a scavenger hunt! <br>
            You will have to solve several puzzles and riddles to move on to the next step. <br>
            At the end the gift will present itself! <br>
            For every puzzle you will be tasked to find a word or a phrase. <br>
            To unlock the next stage, you will need to add the solution to the url. <br>
            For example, for the first step, the word is <b>start</b>, to start u will therefore have to go to <b>KarelPeeters123.github.io/Gift/start.html</b> <br>
            If the task is to find a phras you will need to add all the words together (no spaces), so for <b>I Love You</b> you'll have to go to  <b>KarelPeeters123.github.io/Gift/iloveyou.html</b> <br>
            To start of go to <b>KarelPeeters123.github.io/Gift/start.html</b> or click <a href="start.html">this link</a>
