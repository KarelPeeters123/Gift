        <h1>1st Clue: A rebus!</h1>
        <p>
            Dear Lujane, your first clue to solve is a rebus as seen below. <br>
            If you're unfamiliar with them, you write  out the word the image shows, and add or subtract letters as indicated <br>
            The solution consists of 4 words, 1 under the other (remember that to get to the next clue you need to go to <b>KarelPeeters123.github.io/Gift/[youranswer].html</b>) <br>
            (In case you're wondering, yes that's my eye) <br>
            I hope you enjoy this clue!!
