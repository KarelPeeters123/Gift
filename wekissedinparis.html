        <h1>2nd Clue: A Crossword!</h1>
        <p>
            Dear Lujane, your second clue to solve is a crossword as seen below. <br>
            Once you have solved it, a 5 letter world will reveal itself by adding the letters with the red A, B, C, D, E to each other in that order.<br>
            It'll be obvious if you got it right. <br>
            I hope you enjoy this crossword puzzle just as much as the last!!
